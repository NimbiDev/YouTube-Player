### Instructions

**Windows**:

---

 - **If NodeJS is installed**: The setup will auto compile the application into the `%SystemDrive%\Apps\YouTube Player` directory.

    - Finally, once it is done compiling your application simply double-click the shortcut on your desktop or in your start menu to run the application. 

 - **If NodeJS is NOT installed**: The setup will open your browser to the official download page for **NodeJS** and automatically download the required **NodeJS** version for you. 
    - Run the downloaded **NodeJS** installer.
    - Then, run the `YouTubePlayer-setup.exe` file again.
    - From there, simply wait for it to finish compiling your application.

### Notes

 - The Windows installer creates a shortcut to a `app.vbs` file that runs the compiled **YouTube** app. This is used for debug logging to help with any errors that people may or may not have. *This shortcut gets created regardless of whether the app is compiled or not*. To avoid confusion, make sure that the required version of **NodeJS** is installed ***before*** running the `YouTubePlayer-setup.exe`.
